# Steam stats

This project was made as part of course Unix OS.

This project was obligate to complete to get highest mark from UNIX course. I have been chosen the “default project”. That means that I needed install any Linux distribution and wrote shell script that is fetching data periodically from any online resource. 

## Motivation

The motivation for the project was to learn more about Linux possibilities and shell scripting. I have not been using Linux much, so it was a good chance to learn something new and what is required by employers. 

## Goals

My main goal was to learn as much as possible about Linux environment and how to survive in it. Also, I wanted to get more experience in writing shell scripts. 

## Short description

I was recommended to install Linux Mint distribution, because it is good for novice in the Unix environment. It was easy for me to adapt, because Linux Mint has a user-friendly interface and a lot of documentation. 

For the project I decide to gather number of users online in Steam service. I decided to fetch data from the website steamdb.info every hour. I was saving next data:
* Right now
* 24-Hour peak
* All-time peak

“Right now” field shows how much users were at current hour at 00 minutes (**:00).
I have data history which saves last 10 records. Using in this data history field “Right now” I create graph.
